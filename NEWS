        New in Release 1.6.8
        --------------------
* modifications to print_world_values.c

        New in Release 1.6.7
        --------------------
* extended sphere_resample_obj to resample a surface based on a
  surface map of different size (for hi-res surfaces)
* fixed compute_icbm_vols: account for volume of voxel (0.5mm or 1.0mm)
  and accept multiple surfaces for the brain mask
* fixed bug in sphere_resample_obj for parsing of lines with leading spaces
* added rgb to volume_object_evaluate for DTI maps
* extended mincdefrag for large volumes

        New in Release 1.6.6
        --------------------
* removed -mask_binvalue from mincmask.c and fixed the old way of
  thresholding for the mask
* removed stx_segment and moved it to registration package
* added sphere_resample_obj.in for resampling an object

        New in Release 1.6.5
        --------------------
* move all obj tools to bicpl/tools where they should belong

        New in Release 1.6.4
        --------------------
* Add icbm_make_templates.pl
* fixed convex_hull.c
* fixed surface_mask.c and surface_mask2.c to save output with same dimensions
  order as original image (was always z, y, x before)
* fixed stx_segment to apply mask correctly (use sensible threshold instead
  of zero which is prone to rounding errors)

        New in Release 1.6.3
        --------------------
* Modification of multispectral_stx_registration for new pipeline
* Use model icbm_avg_152_t1_tal_nlin_symmetric_VI in nlfit_smr
* Creation of convert_object.c.

        New in Release 1.6.2
        --------------------
* Clean-up MNI::DataDir in perl scripts.

        New in Release 1.6.1
        --------------------
* Fix the same small bug in mincdefrag and mincskel for image bounds checking.

        New in Release 1.6
        ------------------
* Added mincdefrag and mincskel.

        New in Release 1.5
        ------------------
* Added various homeless, orphan, perl scripts: stx_segment,
  smooth_mask, mritotal_suppress, compute_icbm_vols, nlfit_smr,
  multispectral_stx_registration
* Added mincmask
* Still more build tweaks

        New in Release 1.4
	------------------

* Added epm-header
* compatibility changes for OSX (sqrtf())
* Added normalize_pet to the package
* Added find_peaks
* Added match_tags
* Build fixes

	New in Release 1.3
	------------------

* New option for surface_mask2: -output_binary_mask.
* ascii_binary removed to package "bicpl".
* average_objects now works.


	New in Release 1.2
	------------------

* Bug fix: surface_mask2 exits with correct status.


	New in Release 1.1
	------------------

* Build fixes.


	New in Release 1.0
	------------------

* A configure script to ease building the tools.

* surface_mask2 changed to force inclusion of object boundaries
  FIXME: need user-level description; is it a bug fix or feature change?

* Bug fixes:
  - tagtominc now correctly interprets the structure_id parameter
  - make_gradient_volume outputs magnitude rather than squared magnitude
    of the gradient vectors
