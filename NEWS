        New in Release 1.6.4
        --------------------
* Add icbm_make_templates.pl
* fixed convex_hull.c
* fixed surface_mask.c and surface_mask2.c to save output with same dimensions
  order as original image (was always z, y, x before)
* fixed stx_segment to apply mask correctly (use sensible threshold instead
  of zero which is prone to rounding errors)

        New in Release 1.6.3
        --------------------
* Modification of multispectral_stx_registration for new pipeline
* Use model icbm_avg_152_t1_tal_nlin_symmetric_VI in nlfit_smr
* Creation of convert_object.c.

        New in Release 1.6.2
        --------------------
* Clean-up MNI::DataDir in perl scripts.

        New in Release 1.6.1
