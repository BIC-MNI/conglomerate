	* Update: Updated all the current files from the checked-out
	versions in ~david/Source/Batch_processing.  This is tagged with
	David-RCS-update.

	* RCS: The first import into CVS is a straight copy of
	~david/Source/Batch_processing/RCS, plus this ChangeLog file.
	This collection of files is tagged David-RCS.

	* symlinks: The following symlinks were replaced by their target
	files: test.obj, tt.obj.

	* symlinks: The following symlinks were removed:
	00100_81920.obj.gz, 00101, MNE.mnc,
	phantom_1-0mm_normal_wht_20480.obj, 00100_20480.obj.gz.


	* Batch_processing: Copied all of ~david/Source/Batch_processing
	except "RCS/test_dynamic.c,v" and "sean", which were
	read-protected.  Both files are old, dating to February 1996.  For
	"test_dynamic.c", the checked-out file is newer, in any case.
