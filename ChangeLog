2003-10-14  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* ascii_binary.c: Delete.  This program was moved to package
	bicpl on 2001-04-02 and the former is a prerequisite of this
	package.

	* Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): Remove ascii_binary.

2003-09-08  Jason Lerch    <jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* added a -output_binary_mask option to surface_mask2

2003-08-29  Jason Lerch    <jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* fixed a bug in surface_mask2 which caused it to fail when the
	histogram of the input volume was skewed and the volume had a
	datatype other than NC_BYTE. Now reads in volume using
	MI_ORIGINAL_TYPE. 

2003-04-30  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* average_objects.c: Completed the code.

2003-01-25  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.ac: Set version to 1.2.

2003-01-25  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.ac: Set version to 1.1.

	* Makefile.am (m4_files): Add m4/smr_CGAL_MAKEFILE.m4.

2002-04-06  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* marching_cubes: Get the voxel_to_world_transform from
	volume_input structure.  Patch from John Sled.

	* Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): Add marching_cubes.

2002-04-06  Steve M. Robbins  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* marching_cubes.c: Copied the RCS file
	~david/Source/Marching_cubes/RCS/marching_cubes.c,v to the CVS
	repository.  After checkout, copied the (unchecked-in)
	marching_cubes.c file overtop.

2001-11-12  Jason Lerch       <jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* added ParseArgv.{c,h}
	* volume_object_evaluate.c: added ParseArgv includes, added
	options letting the user specify whether they want to use linear,
	nearest_neighbour, or cubic interpolation in the evaluation.
	* Makefile.am: added volume_object_evaluate_SOURCES with
	ParseArgv.c
	
2001-11-07  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* make_gradient_volume.c (main): Correct parameter ordering
	for create_gradient_volume() call.
	(create_gradient_volume): Output magnitude rather than squared
	magnitude.  Set the real_range on output volume correctly.

2001-10-28  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* mincresample.c:
	* mincresample.h: Removed.  Was a 1996 version of the files from
	MINC.

	* Makefile.am: Removed all traces of mincresample.  Add 
	AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS, ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS and EXTRA_DIST so that
	"make distcheck" works.

	* tagtominc.c (main): Bugfix.  Pass tag_id as the structure
	ID list, not the patient ID list.

	* README: New.  Describes the usage of some of these
	utilities.

	* TODO:
	* NEWS: New.

	* configure.ac: Use AC_PROG_LIBTOOL instead of AM_.

	* autogen.sh: Add explanatory text if directory m4 is not present.

2001-10-22  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* *.c: Replace <internal_volume_io.h> by
	<volume_io/internal_volume_io.h>.  Replace <images.h> and
	<numerical.h> by <bicpl/...>.

	* configure.in: Do not check for header <numerical.h>, nor for
	<internal_volume_io.h>.  Do not probe for C++ compiler.

2001-09-24  Jason Lerch   <jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* minc_to_rgb.c: Changed UNSIGNED_LONG to UNSIGNED_INT

2001-09-06  Jason Lerch   <jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* surface_mask2: Changed the logic so that an explicity binary
	volume is created which is used to mask the original volume. Also
	forced the inclusion of the object boundaries in the mask.

2001-06-04  Peter Neelin  <neelin@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* print_all_label_bounding_boxes: Fixed test for y_max that was
	testing against the xw coordinate, rather than yw.
	
	
2001-05-11  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* Update: Add files in ~david/Source/Batch_processing that did not
	have an associated RCS file.  Add subdirectories Conglomerate and
	Csh.  The files "test.obj" and "tt.obj" were converted to ascii
	format.  Other obvious junk was removed, mostly files full of
	curvature numbers, and the like.  This is tagged with
	David-2001-05-11.

	* Update: Updated all the current files from the checked-out
	versions in ~david/Source/Batch_processing.  This is tagged with
	David-RCS-update.

	* RCS: The first import into CVS is a straight copy of
	~david/Source/Batch_processing/RCS, plus this ChangeLog file.
	This collection of files is tagged David-RCS.

	* symlinks: The following symlinks were replaced by their target
	files: test.obj, tt.obj.

	* symlinks: The following symlinks were removed:
	00100_81920.obj.gz, 00101, MNE.mnc,
	phantom_1-0mm_normal_wht_20480.obj, 00100_20480.obj.gz.


	* Batch_processing: Copied all of ~david/Source/Batch_processing
	except "RCS/test_dynamic.c,v" and "sean", which were
	read-protected.  Both files are old, dating to February 1996.  For
	"test_dynamic.c", the checked-out file is newer, in any case.
